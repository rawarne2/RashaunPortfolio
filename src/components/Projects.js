          Can you never decide on where to go out to eat? If so then this is the
          app for you! Meal Wheel lets you enter as many restaurants as you want
          and puts it on the wheel. Then you can either try to land on a certain
          one if your quick enough, or just randomly stop it. This app was built
          with React Native.

          Fullstack Fitness is a React Native mobile application that I created
          for my Hackathon project at Fullstack Academy. I had just over 2 class
          days to work on this project and it was my first interaction with
          React Native. This app can track how far you run or bike and a timer
          to let you know how long you have been active. There is also an
          audible notification every 5 minutes that lets you know how far you
          have traveled.

          This application provides information about LCA Properties, LLC and
          allows residents to submit maintenance requests. This will eventually
          be used by real residents and showcase more properties when it is
          complete. It was made using an Angular frontend with express and node
          on the backend.

          This is a React Native application that currently uses Amazon Cognito
          for user management and authentication. It will also use Redux,
          TypeScript, GraphQL, Graphene, PostreSQL, Apollo, and Jest. This app
          will allow trainers to upload exercise videos and create curated
          workouts for their client. This will also include a a library of
          exercises, create your own workout, nutrition tracker, exercise of the
          day, and more!

        These are just a few of the projects that I have worked on. These
        projects were made to practice skills that I already have, as well as to
        learn new ones. I'm constantly updating these and adding new ones, so
        come back often to see what I'm up to! After learning a variety of new
        skills during my apprenticeship, I have realized that there is a lot of
        room for improvement for these projects even though they are just proof
        of concept. I am currently working on a new application for a dating app
        that will eventually be released on the App Store and Google Play. This
        app will use React Native, Django, and MongoDB.
