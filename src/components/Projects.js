                    <p>Fullstack Fitness is a React Native mobile application that I created for my Hackathon project at Fullstack Academy. I had just over 2 class days to
                        work on this project and it was my first interaction with React Native. This app can track how far you run or bike and a timer to let you know how 
                        long you have been active. There is also an audible notification every 5 minutes that lets you know how far you have traveled.</p>

                    I'm constantly updating these and adding new ones, so come back often to see what I'm up to! After learning a variety of new skills during my apprenticeship, 
                    I have realized that there is a lot of room for improvement for these projects even though they are just proof of concept. My current goal is to put the
