                        lets you enter as many restaurants as you want and puts it on the wheel. Then you can either try 
                        to land on a certain one if your quick enough, or just randomly stop it. This app was built with React Native.</p>

                    <p>Fullstack Fitness is a React Native mobile application that I created for my Hackathon project at Fullstack Academy. I had just over 2 class days to
                        work on this project and it was my first interaction with React Native. This app can track how far you run or bike and a timer to let you know how 
                        long you have been active. There is also an audible notification every 5 minutes that lets you know how far you have traveled.</p>
