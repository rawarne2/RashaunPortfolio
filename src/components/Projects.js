                    <p>NutriYum is a mobile app built with React Native for iOS and Android.

                        lets you enter as many restaurants as you want and puts it on the wheel. Then you can either try 
                        to land on a certain one if your quick enough, or just randomly stop it. This app was built with React Native.</p>

                    <p>Fullstack Fitness is a React Native mobile application that I created for my Hackathon project at Fullstack Academy. I had just over 2 class days to
                        work on this project and it was my first interaction with React Native. This app can track how far you run or bike and a timer to let you know how 
                        long you have been active. There is also an audible notification every 5 minutes that lets you know how far you have traveled.</p>

                    I'm constantly updating these and adding new ones, so come back often to see what I'm up to!</h3>
